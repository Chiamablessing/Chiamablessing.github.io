# Getting Started with Create Pinterest web App

This project aim to build a front-end development like an original app of (pinterest.com) by implementing the core features, user experience and responsiveness(which the original app lack).

Pinterest functions as a virtual pinboard where users can "pin" images and videos to their boards. These pins can be anything from fashion ideas, home decor, recipes, travel destinations, DIY projects, and more. Users can create and organize their boards by themes or interests, making it easy to find and refer back to their saved content.

## `git clone https://github.com/Chiamablessing/portfolio.git`


## Installation

To set up, follow the following steps:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
